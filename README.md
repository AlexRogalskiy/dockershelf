*Dockerfiles* is a repository that serves as a collector for docker recipes that I've found useful for specific cases. All docker images are rebuilt and uploaded weekly (on sundays) via a Travis cron.

Here you can find instructions on how to use them. Enjoy!

I made a minimal image based on Debian Sid so that I can use it as a base for other applications. You can check out its build script [debian/sid-min/build-base.sh](debian/sid-min/build-base.sh) for more details.
